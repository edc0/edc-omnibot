Se pode usar isso aqui se pá: XinuPi is the port of Embedded Xinu to the Raspberry Pi. XinuPi provides a simple, lightweight operating system for the Raspberry Pi that contains several orders of magnitude fewer lines of code than the Linux-based software stacks that normally run on the device. Its purpose is to provide an inexpensive, convenient platform for various areas of computer science education at a University level, including operating systems, embedded systems, networking, and programming languages. Another goal of XinuPi is to document some of the Raspberry Pi’s hardware that has, until this point, been poorly documented or even undocumented. This includes the documentation here as well as XinuPi source code and the documentation generated from comments in it.
